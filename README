📅 Project Information
Work Method: Individual
Duration: 5 working days
Period: 02/23/2026 – 02/27/2026 (before 5:00 PM)
🗂 Project Stages
1️⃣ Data Exploration (EDA)
🎯 Objective
Understand the dataset before any transformation.
🔍 Key Actions
Inspect structure and data types (info(), describe())
Detect missing values (e.g., director, country, rating)
Analyze distributions and frequencies:
Movies vs TV Shows
Genres
Countries
Identify duplicates and anomalies
Create initial visualizations:
Histograms
Countplots
Boxplots
💡 Light cleaning may be performed during this phase for better visualization, without permanently modifying the dataset.
2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation
🎯 Objective
Prepare a clean and structured dataset for analysis and dashboard integration.
🔧 Key Actions
Handle missing values:
Remove rows OR
Replace with "Unknown" or Null
Remove duplicates
Transform multi-value columns:
country
listed_in
Create derived columns:
year_added
month_added
day_added
Duration in minutes
Standardize formats:
Dates
Duration
Content type
💡 All transformations ensure consistency and facilitate analysis and visualization.
3️⃣ Business Analysis & Visualizations
🎯 Objective
Answer business questions and identify trends.
📌 Key Business Questions
What is the distribution by age classification (rating)?
What is the proportion of Movies vs TV Shows (type)?
How many contents were added each year?
How has the catalog evolved over time (Movies vs TV Shows by year)?
How many TV Shows were produced between 2011 and 2021?
Which countries produce the most content?
What is the distribution by country and age classification?
What are the most frequent genres?
What are the dominant content categories?
📊 Recommended Visualizations
Bar Charts → Type, Rating, Genre, Country
Pie Charts → Movies vs TV Shows proportion
Line Charts → Evolution over time
Countplots / Heatmaps → Multi-variable analysis
Combined charts → Comparative insights
💡 All charts include clear titles, labels, and annotations for readability.
4️⃣ Business Insights & Executive Summary
🎯 Objective
Translate data into actionable insights.
📈 Deliverables
Identification of:
Top genres
Top production countries
Dominant content types
Clear answers to business questions
Executive summary for management
Actionable recommendations based on trends
5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
🎯 Objective
Create an interactive dashboard for decision-making.
🔄 Steps
Import cleaned dataset (Python → CSV → Power BI)
Apply transformations in Power Query if needed
Build interactive dashboard with filters:
Content Type
Country
Genre
Year Added
Highlight key KPIs and trends
💡 All transformations must remain consistent with Python processing to avoid discrepancies.
📊 Expected Outcomes
At the end of this project:
The Netflix catalog is fully analyzed
Trends and patterns are identified
Business questions are answered
A clean dataset is ready for reporting
An interactive Power BI dashboard supports strategic decisions
🚀 Project Value
This project demonstrates:
End-to-end data analytics workflow
Data cleaning and transformation skills
Business-oriented analytical thinking
